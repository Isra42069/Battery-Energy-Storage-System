# Battery-Energy-Storage-System
A Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is an electrochemical system that stores electrical energy and releases it when required. 

It acts as a buffer between energy generation (like solar, wind, or the grid) and energy consumption. 

In simple terms: It charges when electricity is cheap or abundant, and discharges when electricity is expensive or needed.
